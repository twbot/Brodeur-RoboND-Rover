## Notebook Analysis

Within this Jupyter Notebook are all the functions providing the necessary data that will allow the rover to autonomously navigate its environment.

### Sample Data

In the simulator, you can toggle a grid onto the the ground for calibration. Figure 1 is an example. We will use this as a reference for the perspective transform, allowing us to choose source points, as well as adjust the offset value from the bottom.
